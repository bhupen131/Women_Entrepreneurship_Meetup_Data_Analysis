# Women_Entrepreneurship_Meetup_Data_Analysis
## Summary :
For this data analysis task, we were provided with a recent dataset from the Women Entrepreneurship Meetup conducted by MKR. Our objective was to clean, analyze, and visualize the dataset based on the responses given by participants to uncover meaningful insights.

Before visualizing the data in Tableau, it first needed to be cleaned. I used Python for the data cleaning process. This involved performing basic NLP techniques for sentiment analysis on participantsâ€™ responses, creating additional columns based on the given data to derive deeper insights, and finally exporting the cleaned dataset into an Excel file. This final dataset was then used for visualization in Tableau.
