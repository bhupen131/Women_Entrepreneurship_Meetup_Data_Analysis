<h2>ðŸ’¼ Women Entrepreneurship Meetup Data Analysis</h2>

<h3>ðŸ“Œ Project Summary</h3>
<p>
For this data analysis task, we were provided with a recent dataset from the Women Entrepreneurship Meetup conducted by <b>MKR</b>. 
Our objective was to clean, analyze, and visualize the dataset based on the responses given by participants to uncover meaningful insights.
</p>
<p>
Before visualizing the data in <b>Tableau</b>, it first needed to be cleaned. I used <b>Python</b> for the data cleaning process. This involved performing basic <b>NLP techniques</b> for sentiment analysis on participants' responses, creating additional columns based on the given data to derive deeper insights, and finally exporting the cleaned dataset into an <b>Excel</b> file. This final dataset was then used for visualization in Tableau.
